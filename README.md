# csv-metabase-driver
A CSV metabase driver based on incredible [csvjdbc](http://csvjdbc.sourceforge.net) driver. I've been [modified it](https://github.com/Markenson/csvjdbc4metabase) to work with metabase.

# Installation
Put [this file](https://github.com/Markenson/csv-metabase-driver/raw/master/release/csv.metabase-driver.jar) on your metabase/plugins diretory and restart Metabase. You'll see a CSV driver option on database creation.

# How to configure it
Check [this](https://github.com/Markenson/csv-metabase-driver/issues/1) for more information.
